Abstract
We obtained the metric of the Schwarzschild-like black hole with loop quantum gravity
(LQG) corrections in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time, under the assumption that the cosmological constant is decoupled in LQG. We investigated its thermodynamics, including
the equation of state, criticality, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy. The P − v graph
was plotted, and the critical behavior was calculated. It was found that, due to the LQG
effect, the quantum-corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole exhibits a critical point and a
critical ratio of 7/18, which differs from the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole’s ratio of
3/8 (the same as that of the Van der Waals system) slightly. However, there are still some
similarities compared to the Van der Waals system, such as the same critical exponents
and a similar P − v graph. Moreover, it is concluded that the energy-momentum tensor
related to the black hole’s mass could violate the conventional first law of thermodynamics.
This modified first law may violate the conservation of Gibbs free energy during the small
black hole-large black hole phase transitions, potentially indicating the occurrence of the
zeroth-order phase transition. The Joule-Thomson expansion was also studied. Interestingly, compared to the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, the LQG effect leads to inversion
points. The inversion curve divides the (P, T ) coordinate system into two regions: a heating region and a cooling region, as shown in detail by the inversion curves and isenthalpic
curves. The results indicated that there is a minimum inversion mass, below which any

black hole will not possess an inversion point.

INTRODUCTION

Since in 1983, Hawking and Page made their groundbreaking research on the thermodynamics of AdS black holes and discovered the phase transitions in SchwarzschildAdS black holes [1], black hole thermodynamics has attracted widespread attention
of researchers. In 1999, Chamblin discovered that there is the first-order phase
transition in RN-AdS black holes, which is similar to the gas-liquid phase transition [2, 3]. Kastor suggested that the mass of an AdS black hole should be regarded
as its enthalpy, with the cosmological constant related to pressure, resulting in the
first law of AdS black holes in an extended phase space [4]. The equation of state for
rotating and higher-dimensional black holes was studied in [5]. In research [6], the
authors introduced the criticality of charged-AdS black holes in detail. An interesting result is that the critical ratios (Pc vc /Tc ) of many black holes exhibit only a slight
deviation from (or are even exactly equal to) the result of the Van der Waals system
3/8 [6–16], which exactly matches that of the Van der Waals system. However, this
deviation can also be significant [17–23]. A notable finding is that M. M. Stetsko
discovered in his work that the critical ratio for a four-dimensional static black hole
in minimal Horndeski gravity with Maxwell and Yang-Mills fields is 75/512, which
is clearly less than 3/8 [24]. These anomalies may provide important implications
for black hole thermodynamics and even for the studies of real gases.
The theme of this paper is the thermodynamics of a type of quantum-corrected
4

black holes. In comparison to classical Einstein gravity, quantum effects are widely
considered by physicists. The theory that incorporates quantum electrodynamics
(QED) and its implications for black holes have been researched in [25, 26]. The
thermodynamics of these black holes was studied in [7], revealing that the QED parameter significantly influences phase transitions and criticality [27, 28]. Moreover,
the impact of high-order QED corrections on black hole phase transitions is also
discussed [8]. On the other hand, in [29], the authors studied low-energy one-loop
quantum corrections to the Schwarzschild geometry. In their expositions, general
relativity is fundamentally a quantum field theory described by effective field theory,
which suggests that low-energy degrees of freedom organize themselves as quantum
fields governed by a local Lagrangian [30]. Loop quantum gravity (LQG) has received considerable attention. In LQG, space-time is discretized into a series of tiny
units called loops, and the properties of black holes in this framework have been
widely studied [31–38]. Recently, a quantum-corrected Schwarzschild space-time in
LQG has been proposed [39]. Interestingly, based on optical properties, the authors
suggested that gravitational collapse in this model could be expressed as a process
of white hole’s generation [39–41]. In thermodynamics, black hole entropy in LQG
was discussed in [42].

In this paper, we intend to study the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-like black
holes in AdS space, including the thermodynamic first law, the equation of state
5

and its criticality. The Joule-Thomson expansion will be discussed as well. Our
work aims to enrich the thermodynamics of AdS black holes in LQG and provide a
reference for theoretical studies or potential observations in the future. This article
is organized as follows: In Sect. II, we obtain the metric of the AdS-Schwarzschildlike black hole in LQG, discuss the existence of black hole solutions. In Sect. III,
we investigate the thermodynamics in detail, including the modified first law, the
equation of state, behavior of the critical point, the heat capacity and the Gibbs
free energy. In Sect. IV, the Joule-Thomson process is researched. We calculate the
inversion and show the inversion curves and the black hole’s isenthalpic curves at
length. Finally, we provide our conclusion and outlook in Sect. V. In this article, we
use natural units G = ℏ = kB = c = 1.

where α = 16 3πγ 3 , with γ being the Barbero-Immirzi parameter in LQG [43]. α
has a dimension of [L2 ], and γ is a dimensionless parameter. It should be noted
6

that γ is argued to be around 0.2 [44, 45], and interestingly, the calculation in [44]
suggests that γ is approximately 0.2375. This value has been widely used in [39–
41, 46]. Therefore, in this article, we assume α to be positive and choose γ as 0.2375
or around 0.2 to ensure the accuracy of the figures and table presented.
Assuming that the cosmological constant is decoupled in LQG theory. According
to the metric generation approach discussed in [47], AdS-Schwarzschild-like black

In black hole thermodynamics, the mass M of the black hole is regarded as its

Of note is that Bekenstein-Hawking area relation does not hold in this context. In
fact, this type of energy-momentum tensor, which includes the black hole’s mass M ,
will violate the conventional first law. This problem could be resolved by modifying
the first law [21, 48]. The modified first law is expressed as
dM = T dS + V dP,

One could demonstrate that the differential form dM = T dS + V dP is not exact
generally. In other words, it is impossible to define a scalar function M such that it
satisfies the modified first law.

(19)

One could find that the positive branch has no physical significance because it does
not converge to the result of the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole if α → 0. Here, we
introduce the specific volume v = 2r+ [6, 49], the equation of state is written as

Compared to a normal Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, the LQG correction introduces
a critical point. We take γ = 0.2375 for an example and plot the P − v graph in
Fig. 2.
The figure reveals that the behavior of isothermal curve is similar to that of Van
der Waals fluid. And it is necessary to point out that in the P − v graph, v cannot
be arbitrarily small, as Eq. 7 and Eq. 20 will yield a minimum value of r+ for a fixed

This result is different from that of the RN-AdS black hole, which is also the result
of the Van der Waals system [6]. An interesting phenomenon is that the critical
ratios of many black holes show only a slight difference from 3/8 [6–16]. However,
this discrepancy also can be significant [17–23]. A typical example is found in the
work of M. M. Stetsko, who discovered that the critical ratio for a four-dimensional
12

static black hole in minimal Horndeski gravity with Maxwell and Yang-Mills fields is
75/512, which is noticeably less than 3/8 [24]. These anomalies will provide valuable
insights for the study of black hole thermodynamics and the equations of state for
gases. Specifically, among the numerous data points, two results are particularly close
to our findings. In [18], the authors found that z = 4 Hořava-Lifshitz black holes
with hyperbolic horizons could exhibit two critical points, resulting in two critical
ratios 0.463188 and 0.386812, the latter of which is close to 7/18. Additionally,
critical ratio of the Hayward-AdS black hole is 0.393031, which is also very close to
our result [17].

As shown in the figure, the heat capacity diverge to infinity at the phase transition
point, which is marked by the dashed lines. When P < Pc (see Fig. 3(a)), the
small black holes-large black holes phase transition is similar to the first-order phase
transition in traditional thermodynamics. At the critical point (see Fig. 3(b)), the
phase transition is similar to the second-order phase transition. We will reanalyze
this phase transition later by calculating the Gibbs free energy.

The Gibbs free energy is shown in Fig. 5. The behavior of Gibbs free energy is
similar to that of the Van der Waals system, G is multivalued when phase transition
occurs. But, there are also some differences. In fact, G (T ) is not necessarily a selfintersecting function even for P < Pc . Even if G (T ) has intersection points, these
points do not indicate phase transition points. In the Van der Waals system, the
first-order phase transition is an isothermal and isobaric process, and since dG =
−SdT + V dP holds, the Gibbs free energy is conserved during the phase transition.

But for this kind of black holes, the conventional first law does not work, and the
differential form of G becomes


dG = −SdT + W −1 V dP + W −1 − 1 T dS.

(30)

Even for an isothermal and isobaric process, G is not conserved. The variation of
Gibbs free energy during the phase transition is

S1

(32)
T (S1 ) = T (S2 ) .

Taking the γ = 0.2375, P = 0.2Pc for an example, Eq. 32 gives the beginning and
the end of the phase transition in the (T, G) coordinate:
ptb = (0.020328, 0.74174) ,
(33)
pte = (0.020328, 0.98797) .
But G (T ) has its self-intersections
i1 = (0.020852, 0.73923) ,
(34)
i2 = (0.019214, 1.3949) .
These results are shown in Fig. 6.
It is shown in the figure that, considering Maxwell’s area law, the actual physical
process could be described as follows: If the black hole undergoes an isobaric expansion, its temperature initially increase until it reaches the phase transition point ptb ,
followed by an isothermal phase transition. During this process, the Gibbs free energy experiences a sudden change in G (T ) graph, rather than a continuous variation
through the intersections i1 and i2 . After the end of the phase transition pte , the
temperature begins to rise again, and the Gibbs free energy decreases continuously.
For our example with γ = 0.2375 and P = 0.2Pc , the change in Gibbs free energy
during the phase transition is ∆G = 0.24623 ̸= 0.

phase transition. Points i1 and i2 are two intersections of G (T ). The result after
considering Maxwell’s area law is marked by the solid line, while the other part is
marked by the dotted line.

It should be noted that, according to Ehrenfest’s classification of phase transitions, a discontinuity in the Gibbs free energy indicates a zeroth-order phase transition. Therefore, the phase transition from a small black hole to a large black
hole that we are discussing should more accurately be referred to as a zeroth-order
phase transition. The zeroth-order phase transition was first discovered in a dilatonic black hole [50], and was also independently confirmed in the slowly rotating
18

Einstein–Maxwell-dilaton black hole [51]. However, we would like to point out that
there is a difference between the mechanisms of these two types of zeroth-order phase
transitions. In studies [50, 51], the zeroth-order phase transitions observed by the
researchers are induced by the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling interaction, and for
these black holes, the first law of thermodynamics dM = T dS + V dP + ΦdQ still
holds, where Φ is the electric potential and Q is the electric charge. In contrast, for
the Schwarzschild black holes with LQG corrections, the first law of thermodynamics is violated, and Eq. 31 leads to the discontinuity of the Gibbs free energy, which
is originally conserved during isothermal and isobaric phase transitions. Moreover,
since Eq. 31 is a general conclusion, for a four-dimensional static spherically symmetric black holes where the energy-momentum tensor explicitly depends on the black
hole’s mass, a zeroth-order phase transition is inevitable when P < Pc .

It gives the last critical exponent δ = 3. It is found that all the exponents are completely consistent with that of the Van der Waals fluid, the RN-AdS black hole and
the Bardeen-Kiselev black hole [6, 21]. Naturally, it conforms to Griffiths, Rushbrooke and Widom functions [9, 52, 53].

JOULE-THOMSON EXPANSION

In 1852, J. P. Joule and W. Thomson conducted a porous plug experiment to
study the internal energy of gases, leading to the discovery of the Joule-Thomson
effect. In their experiment, the gas undergoes an adiabatic throttling process when
it flows from high pressure to low pressure, resulting in a change in temperature.
This process is isenthalpic:
dH = 0.

The regions where µ > 0 and µ < 0 are the cooling region and the heating region
respectively. The point where µ = 0 is referred to as the inversion point.
The Joule-Thomson expansion for AdS black holes in the extended phase space
has been widely studied [54–61]. Since it is suggested that the black hole’s mass M
is equivalent to its enthalpy [4], the Joule-Thomson expansion for AdS black holes
corresponds to a constant mass process dM = 0.

For an inversion curve, it divides the (P, T ) phase space into two zones: the lower
right side of the curve is the heating region, and the upper left side represents the
cooling region. We will examine this in the constant mass curves later.

Mimin is called the minimum inversion mass. Any black holes with a mass smaller
than this value will not exhibit an inversion point. From the inversion curves, the
inversion temperature will achieve its minimum when the inversion pressure Pi = 0,

which also is a constant that is independent of γ. The inversion curves and the
isenthalpic process for different parameters are shown in Fig. 8.
In figure, the mass M of the constant mass curves increases from the inside to the
outside. For each subfigure, the mass M for the second isenthalpic curve is chosen
as the minimum inversion mass. It is clear that the constant mass curve with the
critical mass just reaches its inversion point at Pi = 0. And any black holes with
M < Mimin are always in the heating process.

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We obtain the Schwarzschild-AdS space-time in LQG correction under the assumption that the cosmological constant is decoupled in LQG, and we studied its
thermodynamics, including the modified first law, the equation of state and criticality. We drew P − v graph and found that due to the LQG correction, the
Schwarzschild-AdS black hole exhibits a critical point, and a critical ratio 7/18,
24

which slightly deviates from that of the Van der Waals system. The deviation of the
critical ratio from 3/8 is not uncommon in black hole thermodynamics, potentially
introducing a new insight into the thermodynamics of AdS black holes and even into
the studies of real gas system. Future astronomical observations or thermodynamic
studies of real gases may reveal evidence supporting these findings. Moreover, it is
concluded that if the energy-momentum tensor is related to the black hole’s mass, the
conventional first law does not hold. The corrected first law will violate the conservation of the Gibbs free energy during the phase transition, potentially indicating the
occurrence of the zeroth-order phase transition. Furthermore, the Joule-Thomson
expansion is also discussed in detail. We derived the inversion curves and displayed
the isenthalpic process in (P, T ) graph, showing that the inversion curve will divide
(P, T ) phase space into two regions: the heating region and the cooling region. Additionally, there is a minimum inversion mass, below which any black hole will always
remain in the heating process. Since γ = 0.2375 has been widely used [39–41, 46],
here we provide a brief list of important thermodynamic values in Tab. I for reference. It is our hope that this research could provide a reference for the studies on
AdS-black holes in LQG.

It is necessary to claim that in this article we did not consider the coupling between
LQG and cosmological constant. We believe that taking coupling effect into account
will be an interesting subject. On the other hand, due to the conventional first law

Perhaps there will be a better way to define black hole’s enthalpy and Gibbs free
energy. Moreover, thermodynamics of rotating black hole is also studied in [5, 62–
65]. So it will bring us more interesting phenomena if we consider the rotation of
black hole in LQG.

Appendix A: Modified first law

We denote the metric function of the black hole as f (M, r), where M is black
hole’s mass, and the radius of horizon r+ ensures
f (M, r+ ) = 0.

Eq. 14 has been proven. This conclusion reveals that if the energy-momentum tensor
of spacetime contains the black hole’s mass, the conventional first law will be broken.
Please notice that the assumption Eq. A.12 is necessary, as it could be proven
that even a slight deformation of the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime would invalidate
this conclusion. Considering this metric
